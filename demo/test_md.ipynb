      "Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n",
      "### Non-compliance with laws and regulations\n",
      "Based on:\n",
      "- Our understanding of the Company and the industry in which it operates;\n",
      "- Discussion with management and those charged with governance;\n",
      "- Obtaining and understanding of the Company's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; and\n",
      "- We considered the significant laws and regulations to be the applicable accounting framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax compliance legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance could have a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for example through the imposition of fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to be the health and safety legislation etc, GDPR, Employment Taxes and VAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our procedures in respect of the above included:\n",
      "- Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n",
      "- Review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation;\n",
      "- Review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.\n",
      "### Fraud\n",
      "We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n",
      "- Enquiry with management and those charged with governance regarding any known or suspected instances of fraud;\n",
      "- Obtaining an understanding of the Company's policies and procedures relating to:\n",
      "  - Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and\n",

      "Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our procedures in respect of the above included:\n",
      "- We performed testing in Revenue with specific focus on manual journals to revenue; investigating and obtaining supporting evidence for any unusual items. We assessed whether revenue contra entries are valid and reasonable or whether these entries are to rarely used accounts or accounts which are not normally utilised in relation to revenue;\n",

      "- We checked for unusual account combination journals impacting revenue and journal entries having narratives with director names and specific keywords and tested the appropriateness of these journal entries by agreeing to supporting documentation, with a focus on unusual transactions based on our knowledge of the business, our fraud risk assessment, and enquiries with management.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.\n",

      "### 2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements\n",
      "The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Talon Outdoor Limited has taken advantage of the exemption allowed for preparation of consolidated accounts as consolidated accounts will be prepared by Canis Topco Limited (a parent company of Talon Outdoor Limited and the highest company based in the UK).\n",

      "The following principal accounting policies have been applied:\n",
      "### 2.2 Going Concern\n",
      "The entity is a trading Company and retains a net asset position. The ability of the Company to operate and ensure it has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the signing of these accounts, has been considered and is summarised below.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a successful financial performance in 2023, including growth in net profit, the directors are confident that the company has the resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future. The annual report and accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash\n",
      "Cash levels are strong and the Company monitors and manages its cash flows carefully. Over the 12-month period of potential scenarios to the business, cash balances are forecast to remain at more than adequate levels to fund the Company's planned activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financing facilities\n",
      "Taking account of the realistic steps that the Company and Group can take to mitigate the downside scenarios, these scenarios indicate that the Group will continue to meet the covenant tests contained within its financing facilities. In the opinion of the Directors, the Group's relationships with its lenders remain excellent, and the lenders remain supportive of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Group meets its day-to-day financing and working capital requirements through ongoing operating cash flows, bank loans and shareholder loan notes. There is also access to a revolving credit facility of £17.5m, £10m of which was extended post year end. The Company's forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance under various scenarios, show that it will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.\n",

      "At each year-end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.\n",

All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within 'other operating income'.\n",
      "## 2.4 Turnover\n",
      "Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is billings less agency commission plus other fees, excluding VAT, derived from the provision of services to customers during the year. Turnover is based on the portion of the campaign that has played in the year.\n",

      "While Talon is an advertising agency it acts as a principal in relation to certain aspects of the services that it provides. Talon receives volume rebates from certain suppliers for transactions entered into on behalf of clients that, based on the terms of the relevant contracts and local law, are either remitted to clients or retained by Talon.\n",

However, there is no deferral of costs in respect of this due to the contingent nature and restrictive conditions around the potential realisation of this value, and the reliability in assessing any value in these circumstances.\n",

      "Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the Company's share of its identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over its useful economic life, not exceeding ten years.\n",

Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\n",

      "Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n",
      "\n",
      "For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n",

      "2.12 Dividends\n",
      "\n",
      "Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.\n",

      "2.14 Current and deferred taxation\n",
      "\n",
      "The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.\n",
