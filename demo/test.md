### Section 172 Companies Act 2006
The Board of Directors, individually and collectively, continue to act in a way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole. The information which follows describes how, in performing their duties during the year, the directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172 (1) (a) to (f) of the Act and constitutes the Board's Section 172 Statement for 2023.

The Board has identified its key stakeholders as its customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and the communities in which the business operates. These relationships are important in allowing the Company to achieve its business aims. The following sections below describe how the Board and the senior management of the business engage with the Company's key stakeholders and how it considers their interests when making decisions.

Our purpose, strategy and consideration of the consequences of decisions for the long-term are considered below:

**Our people:** We seek to attract and retain high quality employees and provide them with the information and resources to be effective in their roles. We look to provide them with the appropriate recognition and reward and to develop them in their roles, and to provide them with opportunities to build successful careers.

We hold regular company updates on a monthly basis with more frequent team meetings, have an ongoing Employee Engagement Survey, and implement specific HR initiatives. We currently have flexible working times that allow employees to adjust their days in the office and also operate a core hour policy of 10am to 4:30pm.

**Investors:** We seek to deliver our investors long-term sustainable value-growth through the implementation of clear strategy and direction.

There are monthly meeting of the Group Board including investor directors, together with the provision of details regular and ad hoc management information on the Company's operations and results.

The directors were fully engaged in the key strategic decisions during 2023.These included the further development of the Company's technology platforms, as detailed above, to enhance business's ability to scale and grow.

## Strategic Report (continued)
for the Year Ended 31 December 2023
### Section 172 Companies Act 2006 (continued)
**Customers:** The Company seeks to provide its customers with exceptional service, coupled with industry leading technology, to exceed their expectations in terms of value and returns.

We continue to invest in our people, technology and relationships in order to maintain and extend the levels of service, innovation and value.

**Suppliers:** We work in close partnership with our suppliers across the industry and seek to ensure that we maintain long-term and sustainable relationships and create efficiently across the supply chain.

During 2023 we have continued to increase communications, and strengthen relationships with suppliers further. We believe that the strength of these relationships is of benefit to both our customers and our suppliers.

**Community and Environment:** Much of the work that we do in our communities is linked to the relationships that we have with our staff, customers and suppliers. We have continued to support charity initiatives through 2023 and look to support the involvement of our people in various community initiatives. These initiatives, and the involvement of our people in the decisions around them, are an integral part of Talon's values and culture and are important in creating and maintaining an attractive working environment, as well as communicating Talon's values and culture to a wider audience. We also manage both our direct environmental footprint, as well as that of the relevant OOH supply chains, particularly in relation to the minimisation of energy consumption and waste.

We recognise the impact of the environment on our business and we are committed to producing and maintaining a tangible, practical plan towards tacking our environmental, social and governance (ESG) obligations.
### Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties that have the potential to have the most significant impact on the Company have been identified as follows:
#### External risks
**Economic instability**

A period of economic instability could have an impact on the demand for advertising services and on the Company's ability to grow and develop in line with its plans.

To mitigate this risk, the Company has sought to diversify its activities across different countries, markets and sectors. In the assessment of the directors, the nature of the services provided by the Company are such that the nature of the business is relatively resilient to such risks.

**Natural disaster and other major incidents**

Natural disaster and other major incidents could adversely impact our employees and business.

To mitigate this the Company has a Major Incident Response Plan.
# Talon Outdoor Limited
## Strategic Report (continued)
for the Year Ended 31 December 2023
### Financial Risks
#### Foreign exchange
As the Company's activities have expanded internationally, there is a greater level of exposure to currency fluctuations. Sterling is the reporting currency of the Company.

The Company mitigates this risk through the use of forward currency contracts where appropriate.
#### Liquidity risk
The Company's policy is to ensure that there is appropriate funding and facilities in place to meet foreseen cash requirements within the business.

To mitigate risk in relation to the policy, the Company carries out rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure that it has sufficient cash and facilities in place to meet its requirements. This includes monitoring the performance of the business against the financial covenants on the Company's bank borrowing to ensure that the Company remains within the requirements of these arrangements.

This report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf.

## Directors' Report
### for the Year Ended 31 December 2023
The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.
### Directors
The directors who served during the year were:

B Cupples (resigned 17 October 2024)
J Copley
G Murray (resigned 11 January 2024)
E R Newnham
S R Easterbrook (appointed 25 October 2023)

The director appointed after year end was:

M P Saunter (appointed 1 February 2024)
### Principal activity and future developments
The principal activity of the Company is to provide strategic media planning and buying services for our clients' out-of-home media campaigns and the Company is looking to continue to grow this business, in the UK and internationally.
### Results and dividends
The profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £16,040,000 (2022 - £12,170,000).

The directors have not declared a dividend for 2023 (2022 - Nil).
### Going concern
The entity is a trading Company and retains a net asset position. The ability of the Company to operate and ensure it has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the signing of these accounts, has been considered and is summarised below.

After a successful financial performance in 2023, including growth in net profit, the directors are confident that the company has the resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future. The annual report and accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
### Cash
Cash levels are strong and the Company monitors and manages its cash flows carefully. Over the 12-month period of potential scenarios for the business, cash balances are forecast to remain at more than adequate levels to fund the Company's planned activities.
### Financing facilities
Taking account of the realistic steps that the Company and Group can take to mitigate any downside scenarios, these scenarios indicate that the Group will continue to meet the covenant tests contained within its financing facilities. In the opinion of the Directors, the Group's relationships with its lenders remain excellent, and the lenders remain supportive of the business.

The Group meets its day-to-day financing and working capital requirements through ongoing operating cash flows, bank loans and shareholder loan notes. There is also access to a revolving credit facility of £17.5m, post year end from the previous £7.5m to support working capital. The Company's forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance under various scenarios, show that it will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.

Directors' Report (continued)
for the Year Ended 31 December 2023

Charitable contributions

Donations to charities in the year amounted to Nil (2022 - £60,000).

Energy and Emissions

Under the Companies Regulations 2018 we are required to disclose our UK energy usage and associated
greenhouse gas emissions. Comparative information is shown.
The table is representing energy usage and associated greenhouse gas emissions in the United Kingdom, with columns for data from 2023 and 2022.
UK energy usage covers the purchase of electricity and gas across the UK companies.

The associated greenhouse gas emissions have been calculated by converting the energy data from
electricity bills and converting this to greenhouse gas emissions using the relevant conversion factors
issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

As part of its continued focus on ESG matters, the Group is working on lowering its UK energy usage in
2023. However, due to the acquisitions in the year there has been an overall increase in usage. We will
continue to explore options to reduce future consumption, but the opportunities for doing so are limited
by the relatively low current consumption rates.

Directors' responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'. Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies for the Company's financial statements and then apply them
consistently;

- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

## Directors' Report (continued)
for the Year Ended 31 December 2023
### Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who are directors at the time when this Directors' Report is approved has confirmed that:

- so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and
- the directors have taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.

This report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf.

## Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Talon Outdoor Limited
### Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended;
- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Talon Outdoor Limited ("the Company") for the year ended 31 December 2023 which comprise Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Changes in Equity and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
### Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
### Independence
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
### Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
### Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Talon Outdoor Limited

Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Talon Outdoor Limited

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Other Companies Act 2006 reporting

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic report and the Directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors' report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

## Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Talon Outdoor Limited
### Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
### Non-compliance with laws and regulations
Based on:
- Our understanding of the Company and the industry in which it operates;
- Discussion with management and those charged with governance;
- Obtaining and understanding of the Company's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; and
- We considered the significant laws and regulations to be the applicable accounting framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax compliance legislation.

The Company is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance could have a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for example through the imposition of fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to be the health and safety legislation etc, GDPR, Employment Taxes and VAT.

Our procedures in respect of the above included:
- Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations;
- Review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation;
- Review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.
### Fraud
We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:
- Enquiry with management and those charged with governance regarding any known or suspected instances of fraud;
- Obtaining an understanding of the Company's policies and procedures relating to:
  - Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and
  - Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud.
- Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any known or suspected instances of fraud;
- Discussion amongst the engagement team as to how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and;
- Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud.

Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition.

Our procedures in respect of the above included:
- We performed testing in Revenue with specific focus on manual journals to revenue; investigating and obtaining supporting evidence for any unusual items. We assessed whether revenue contra entries are valid and reasonable or whether these entries are to rarely used accounts or accounts which are not normally utilised in relation to revenue;
Talon Outdoor Limited

Independent Auditors' Report to the Members of Talon Outdoor Limited

- Ensuring the revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the Company's reporting framework and substantively testing a sample of revenue recognised in the period.
- Evaluating and, where appropriate, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in determining accounting estimates in relation to valuation of investments and going concern;
- We checked for unusual account combination journals impacting revenue and journal entries having narratives with director names and specific keywords and tested the appropriateness of these journal entries by agreeing to supporting documentation, with a focus on unusual transactions based on our knowledge of the business, our fraud risk assessment, and enquiries with management.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members who were all deemed to have appropriate competence and capabilities and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023
## 1. General Information
Talon Outdoor Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on the company information page and the nature of the Company's operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report and Directors' report.
## 2. Accounting policies
### 2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note 3).

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Talon Outdoor Limited has taken advantage of the exemption allowed for preparation of consolidated accounts as consolidated accounts will be prepared by Canis Topco Limited (a parent company of Talon Outdoor Limited and the highest company based in the UK).

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under FRS 102 and has not presented its own statement of cash flows in these financial statements, as these are reflected in the parent company consolidated financial statements of Canis Topco Limited, which are available at Companies House.

The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
### 2.2 Going Concern
The entity is a trading Company and retains a net asset position. The ability of the Company to operate and ensure it has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the signing of these accounts, has been considered and is summarised below.

After a successful financial performance in 2023, including growth in net profit, the directors are confident that the company has the resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future. The annual report and accounts have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.

Cash
Cash levels are strong and the Company monitors and manages its cash flows carefully. Over the 12-month period of potential scenarios to the business, cash balances are forecast to remain at more than adequate levels to fund the Company's planned activities.

Financing facilities
Taking account of the realistic steps that the Company and Group can take to mitigate the downside scenarios, these scenarios indicate that the Group will continue to meet the covenant tests contained within its financing facilities. In the opinion of the Directors, the Group's relationships with its lenders remain excellent, and the lenders remain supportive of the business.

The Group meets its day-to-day financing and working capital requirements through ongoing operating cash flows, bank loans and shareholder loan notes. There is also access to a revolving credit facility of £17.5m, £10m of which was extended post year end. The Company's forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance under various scenarios, show that it will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)
## 2.3 Foreign currency translation
### Functional and presentation currency
The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP.
### Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

At each year-end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within 'finance income or costs'. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within 'other operating income'.
## 2.4 Turnover
Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is billings less agency commission plus other fees, excluding VAT, derived from the provision of services to customers during the year. Turnover is based on the portion of the campaign that has played in the year.

While Talon is an advertising agency it acts as a principal in relation to certain aspects of the services that it provides. Talon receives volume rebates from certain suppliers for transactions entered into on behalf of clients that, based on the terms of the relevant contracts and local law, are either remitted to clients or retained by Talon.

If amounts are passed on to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settled or, to the extent they are retained by Talon, they are recorded as revenue when earned. Variable incentive-based revenue typically comprises both quantitative and qualitative elements.
## 2.5 Gross profit
Gross profit arises from fees and commissions earned in respect of turnover, which meets the Companies Act definition of turnover. Gross profit is recognised when services are performed and substantially all income occurs in the UK.
## 2.6 Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the direct costs associated with supplying the media and services to our clients and represents the cost to Talon of providing these services, including third party services arranged by the Company. Cost of sales are based on the portion of the campaign that has played in the year in line with revenue recognition.

# Talon Outdoor Limited
## Notes to the Financial Statements
### For the Year Ended 31 December 2023
2. Accounting policies (continued)
### 2.6 Cost of sales (continued)
Under certain limited arrangements, and subject to very restrictive conditions, the Company has the potential to realise additional value in the following year for certain media. However, there is no deferral of costs in respect of this due to the contingent nature and restrictive conditions around the potential realisation of this value, and the reliability in assessing any value in these circumstances.
### 2.8 Intangible assets
#### Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the Company's share of its identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over its useful economic life, not exceeding ten years.
#### Other Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years.

The estimated useful life is as follows:

Software - 20% on cost

Expenditure on externally purchased products is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:

- adequate resources are available to maintain and complete the development;
- there is the intention to complete and develop the assets for future economic benefit;
- the Company is able to use the asset;
- use of the asset will generate future economic benefit; and
- expenditure on the development of the asset can be measured reliably.
### 2.9 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Depreciation on other assets is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.

The estimated useful lives range as follows;
This table is representing a depreciation schedule for various assets, with columns indicating the asset type and the rate at which it is being depreciated.
The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.

Talon Outdoor Limited

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended 31 December 2023

2. Accounting policies (continued)

2.9 Tangible fixed assets (continued)

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

2.10 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

2.11 Financial instruments

Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received.

Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.12 Dividends

Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.

2.13 Operating leases: the company as lessee

Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset.

2.14 Current and deferred taxation

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
